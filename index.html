				Easter Island is a small island in the pacific ocean, far from any other islands. Easter Island is most known for its ancient statues, out of the way location, and its great views. You can find several of these heads scattered about the Rapa Nui national park. You can also go to Rano Kau, a beautiful circular crater with several miniature lakes inside.
				<h2>Location</h2>
				Easter Island lies midway between Tahiti and Chile, with the nearest inhabited island being Pitcairn Island, which is 1900 kilometers away. Easter Island also happens to be the one of the southernmost and easternmost island of the pacific.<br/>

				<h2>Geography</h2>
				The island is traingularly shaped, with a volcano at each corner. The interior is made up of plateus and craters, surrounded by costal bluffs. The capital city of easter island is Hanga Roa, but there is also Orongo, the ceremonial center of the island.
				<h2>Activities</h2>
				Activities on Easter Island include:
				<ul class="activity list">
					<li>Scuba Diving</li>
					<li>Surfing, snorkeling and more at the Orca Diving Center</li>
					<li>Night diving</li>
					<li>Yacht tours</li>
					<li>And horseback riding</li>
				</ul>
				For entertainment, look no further than the Kari Kari Ballet Cultural, which performs several nights a week. Alternatively, you could go boogey at the Toroko or PiRiTi. The annual average temperature on the island is 20.3&deg; celcius, with occasional rainfalls 140 days of the year.
				<h2>Getting There</h2>
				You have two main options, by boat or by plane. If you want to go by plane, the best option is to go with LAN airlines, or you can go by boat on the Gobernación Marítima Hanga Roa.<br/>
				<h2>Appropriate Conduct</h2>
				The archaeological sites on easter island can be easily damaged, and acts like climbing on the fallen statues ruin the experience for everyone, especially future visitors. It is strictly prohibited to take ancient artifacts, or disturb them in any way.
				<h2>Food</h2>
				The number of restaurants and snack bars is growing, and there are several options available to you. Test your palate with a rubberfish, an oily fish with a powerful taste, loved by locals but not something the western palate is entirely familiar with. You can also try the local tuna, or the completo, (hot dog) but be wary of restaurants that claim to have prices in the single digit range. Some more specific restaurants include:
				<ul class="restaurants">
					<li>Te Moana (yes like the disney princess)</li>
					<li>Aloha Pub</li>
					<li>Or, for more lavish travelers, Restaurant La Taverne Du Pêcheur</li>
				</ul>
